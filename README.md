# Restate Typescript SDK

[Restate](https://restate.dev/) is a system for easily building resilient applications using *distributed durable async/await*. This repository contains the Restate SDK for writing services in **Node.js / Typescript**.

Restate applications are composed of *durably executed, stateful RPC handlers* that can run either
as part of long-running processes, or as FaaS (AWS Lambda).

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

const greeter = restate.service({
    name: "greeter",
    handlers: {
        greet: async (ctx: restate.Context, name: string) => {
            return `Hello ${name}!`;
        },
    },
});

restate.endpoint()
    .bind(greeter)
    .listen(9080);
```

## Using the SDK

To use this SDK, add the dependency to your project:
```shell
npm install @restatedev/restate-sdk
```

For brand-new projects, we recommend using the [Restate Node Template](https://github.com/restatedev/node-template-generator):
```shell
npx -y @restatedev/create-app@latest
```

## Versions

## Contributing

We‚Äôre excited if you join the Restate community and start contributing!
Whether it is feature requests, bug reports, ideas & feedback or PRs, we appreciate any and all contributions.
We know that your time is precious and, therefore, deeply value any effort to contribute!

### Building the SDK

#### Prerequisites
- [NodeJS (and npm)](https://nodejs.org) installed

Install the dependencies and transpile the TypeScript code:
```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

If everything goes well, the artifact would be created at `dist/`.

### Testing Changes

Run the tests via
```shell
npm run test
```

Run the formatter and linter via
```shell
npm run format
npm run lint
```

Launch a sample program (requires no build)
```shell
npm run example
```

### Testing end-to-end with Restate Server

See https://github.com/restatedev/e2e/ for more details.

## Releasing the package

### Releasing via release-it

Releasing a new npm package from this repo requires:

* [SSH access configured for Github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) in order to push commits and tags to GitHub
* A GitHub personal access token with access to https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-typescript in your environment as `GITHUB_TOKEN` in order to create a Github release

```bash
release-it
```

The actual `npm publish` is run by GitHub actions once a GitHub release is created.

### Releasing manually

1. Bump the version field in package.json to `X.Y.Z`
2. Create and push a tag of the form `vX.Y.Z` to the upstream repository
3. [Create a new GitHub release](https://github.com/restatedev/sdk-typescript/releases)

Creating the GitHub release will trigger `npm publish` via GitHub actions.

After having created a new SDK release, you need to:

1. [Update and release the tour of Restate](https://github.com/restatedev/tour-of-restate-typescript#upgrading-typescript-sdk)
2. [Update the Typescript SDK and Tour version in the documentation and release it](https://github.com/restatedev/documentation#upgrading-typescript-sdk-version)
3. [Update and release the Node template generator](https://github.com/restatedev/node-template-generator#upgrading-typescript-sdk)
4. [Update the examples](https://github.com/restatedev/examples#upgrading-the-sdk-dependency-for-restate-developers)
