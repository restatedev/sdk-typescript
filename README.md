# Restate Typescript SDK

[Restate](https://restate.dev/) is a system for easily building resilient applications using *distributed durable async/await*. This repository contains the Restate SDK for writing services in **Node.js / Typescript**.

Restate applications are composed of *durably executed, stateful RPC handlers* that can run either
as part of long-running processes, or as FaaS (AWS Lambda).

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";

const greeter = restate.service({
    name: "greeter",
    handlers: {
        greet: async (ctx: restate.Context, name: string) => {
            return `Hello ${name}!`;
        },
    },
});

restate.serve({ services: [greeter], port: 9080 });
```
