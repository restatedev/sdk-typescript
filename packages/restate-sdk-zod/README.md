# Restate Typescript SDK Zod integration

[Restate](https://restate.dev/) is a system for easily building resilient applications using *distributed durable async/await*.

This package contains a zod integration, allowing to define input/output models of your handlers.

```typescript
import * as restate from "@restatedev/restate-sdk";
import { serde } from "@restatedev/restate-sdk-zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const Greeting = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
});

const greeter = restate.service({
  name: "greeter",
  handlers: {
    greet: restate.handlers.handler(
      {
        input: serde.zod(Greeting),
        output: serde.zod(z.string()),
      },
      async (ctx, greeting) => {
        return `Hello ${greeting.name}!`;
      }
    ),
  },
});

export type Greeter = typeof greeter;

restate.endpoint().bind(greeter).listen();
```
